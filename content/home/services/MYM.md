Located in the Bay Area, we were founded in the Spring of 2021 and are composed of middle and high schoolers across many schools. We have donated to organizations around the world, including UNICEF and Calfire etc. Our mission is to bring classical music to everyday life. Through music, we raise funds for charities around the world and bring together a community of passionate youth musicians.
