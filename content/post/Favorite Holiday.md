My favorite holiday is:

Halloween!!

- You can reflect on what was your favorite character in the past year
- Share bondings with friends as you discuss whether you want to make a group costume together and make plans for trick or treat
- A demonstration of school spirit during our annual parade showcasing our costume around campus
- During October leading up to Halloween, I can use the promise of taking him trick-or-treating as a bribe to my little brother to listen to me. ;p
