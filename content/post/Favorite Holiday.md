My favorite holiday is:

Halloween!!

- You can reflect on what was your favorite character in the past year
- Share bondings with friends as you discuss whether you want to make a group costume together and make plans for trick or treat
- A demonstration of school spirit during our annual parade showcaseing our costume around campus
- During October leading up to Halloween, can use the promise of taking him to trick-or-treat as a bribe to little brother for listening to me.
