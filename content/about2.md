Who am I?

In About ME 1.0, you learned about my academic endeavors and my formal extracurricular pursues. But, what, really do I enjoy doing besides those "formal accomplishments", and what really do I look like outside of that little circle of my face shown in my portrait (cough cough totally not photoshopped).

Hi, My name is Wang Yi Ran. My name is also Irene Wang. I am 5 feet 6 tall (a height that is convenient for volleyball and helping my mom reach for stuff on the shelf, a height that I am proud of but just )
I was born in the metropolitan center of China - Shanghai, and showered in its culture and tradition for the first century of my life.
